      <h2> Mezze Night – May 30th, 2025 ($20) </h2>
      <p>A night inspired by legendary chef Yotam Ottelenghi - a James Beard Award winning chef that is leading Middle Eastern cuisine in London. My favorite, festive recipes of his to kick off this incredible series. In addition 
      to the menu, there will also be a date and orange infused whiskey cocktail - available as a mocktail as well. Ingredients are sourced from farmer's markets, single source, traceable spaces. </p>
      <p> Time: 6:30pm </p>
      <p> Dress code: Casual</p>

      <h2>Duck, Duck, Mousse – June 27th, 2025 ($25) </h2>
      <p> Duck is, perhaps, my favorite protein. An intimidating thing to bring into your kitchen, but excellent when done well. I am celebrating my favorite duck dishes in the second night of this series. This
      will be paired with an anise gin cocktail - can be made into a mocktail as well. Duck is also an incredible creature to have on farmland, so making it more marketable will give farmers more reason to incorporate them
      into their operations. </p>
       <p> Time: 6:30pm </p>
      <p> Dress code: Casual </p>

      <h2>Peak Summer – July 25th, 2025 ($25) </h2>
      <p> Summer is a time of bounty - veggies coming in each day provide the perfect foil to creating a classic American Summer Spread. This year, I have also began my journey of fermenting - which will 
      be highlighted through the courses of this meal. Produce is supplied by Deep Roots Farm and my own home garden - including the watermelons and most of the fruit. This will be paired with a summer sangria - packed with 
      the beautiful fruit bounty of our local growing spaces. Cheeseburgers also happen to be my second favorite food. </p>
       <p> Time: 6:30pm </p>
      <p> Dress code: Something floral! </p>
